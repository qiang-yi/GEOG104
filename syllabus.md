### Overview
This course is intended as an introduction to maps as tools for geographers. It will use digital mapping techniques as well as traditional topographic and thematic maps as concrete and accessible starting points for introducing the kinds of maps and images used by geographers, as well as methods for data collection, interpretation, analysis, and presentation that we have found useful. In addition to a digital form of maps, this course views digital map as a complex decision-making process including data acquisition, data modeling and storage, analysis, interpretation, and inference. Additionally, this course will introduce cutting-edge techniques in big data and cyberinfrastructure and how these techniques are revolutionizing the way that we collect and utilize geospatial information.

The specific learning outcomes are:
* 	Being able to correctly interpret map and use map to do measurement, analysis and decision-making;
* 	Have a basic understanding of geographical information systems (GIS)
* 	Being able to use GIS to create different types of maps using different forms of geospatial data
* 	Being familiar with the development of geospatial technologies in the Era of Big Data and Web 2.0.

### Readings and Materials
Suggested textbook (not required):

*A. Jon Kimerling, Aileen R. Buckley, Phillip C. Muehrcke, and Juliana O. Muehrcke. 2009. Map Use: Reading and Analysis (6th ed.). Esri Press.*

Supplementary readings will be recommended weekly

 
### Course Structure: 
•	30 lectures & labs, including 10 assignments/lab exercises.
•	2 exams (1 mid-terms, 1 final)
•	Participation

### Grading:
Grading: Grading will be based on my best professional judgment of our performance on a set of weighted components. The components and weights are:
- 50% - Weekly homework assignments
- 15% - Midterm exam (short answer)
- 25% - Final exam (short answer)
- 10% - Participation


### Course lab work
Labs will be introduced in class and explanation will be given to accomplish the tasks.  Time will be allotted in class to work on the labs.  If more time is needed, they can be finished after class.  The teaching assistant will collect and grade the labs. **Labs up to 1 week late are penalized 20%. Labs more than 1 week late are penalized 100%.**

Please note you may work together on labs, but you each must do every part of each lab, and **turn in entirely your own work**.  That means each of you should perform every step indicated in the lab manual. **Your grade is for individual effort; copied files/maps from other students will be construed as cheating, at a minimum you’ll get zero for the lab, and you may automatically fail the course.**

Most labs will be done in computer. We will set up an account for every student in the computer lab. The software to be used is ArcGIS 10, its extensions (such as spatial analyst and 3D analyst) and web mapping tools (e.g. Google Maps/Earth).

Finished lab assignments should be submitted in **Microsoft Word** or **PDF** format through **Laulima**. Lab instructions will contain numbered questions to be answered and very specific deliverables such as maps, tables and graphs.
