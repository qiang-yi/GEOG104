G.PROJECTOR

Introduction

  G.Projector is a Java application that enablesen you to explore a large collection of
  global and regional map projections and optionally re-project an input GIF, JPEG or
  PNG map image. The input map image must use the equirectangular projection or the
  cylindrical equal-area, Robinson or Winkel Tripel projection. Some KMZ files may also be
  used for input. Lon-lat gridlines and continental outlines may be drawn on the map, and
  the resulting map images may be saved to disk in GIF, JPEG, PDF, PNG, PS or TIFF form.

  G.Projector requires that Java 8 Runtime Environment be installed on your computer.
  This probably means that you must have installed a Jave JRE downloaded from Java.com.
  For more info about installing Java on Windows, see

Downloading

  The current version of G.Projector, along with other information about the application,
  may always be found at

Installing and running the G.Projector for Windows Package

  After unzipping the downloaded G.Projector archive, simply move the G.Projector folder
  to wherever you prefer to keep your applications programs on your PC.
  
  The complete G.Projector package for Windows should include the following items:
  
  - Double-clickable G.Projector.exe application launcher.
  - Java application G.Projector.jar and library *.jar files in a folder called "jars".
  - Sample input map images in a directory called "sample_maps".
  - This README file.
  
  To run G.Projector, just double-click on the G.Projector.exe application icon.


JAR Files

  The folder called "jars" _must_ remain in the same location as the G.Projector.exe
  application. Also, any .jar files in that folder must remain there. If you move or
  remove the folder or any of its contents, G.Projector will not work.


Continent Overlays Files

  If you are looking for additional overlay files compatible with G.Projector, any of
  the optional "outline overlays" available from the Panoply software website may be
  used. See
  
    https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/overlays/

  G.Projector can also use many outline or multipoint SHP shapefiles as overlays.

  To add an overlay to G.Projector's library, go to its Preferences window, select the
  Overlays tab, and click the "+" icon at lower left of the table listing of overlays.


Help and Other Documentation

  You _must_ manually unzip the GProjector.zip archive file or else G.Projector will
  not work. Do not simply open the zip file on your desktop and doubleclick on the
  G.Projector.exe icon.
  
  If you do not have a Jave Runtime Environment installed on your computer, go to
  the Java.com website

    http://www.java.com/
  
  and click on the "Free Java Download" button. You must have administrator
  privileges in order to install Java on your Windows computer.
